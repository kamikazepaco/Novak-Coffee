# Novak template rebuild

## BLUF 

reb uild the Novak template in both vanilla js and nextJS using only documentations.

## Overview

In order to test my knowledge and potential shortcomings, I am building the landing page from story site named Novak (https://www.storysite.co/storybrand-website-templates/p/novak-template). I chose this landing page for 3 reasons. 

1. I love the consept of story brands and even employ it religiously in my own detailing business.

2. I wanted a quality wireframe to work with. although I dont have the Figma files, I  think its pretty good quality for me to work with (live demo will help)

3. coffee is life ☕️

## Objectives & deadline

Despite the face that im still a new developer, I want, to treat this as if its a real client and project with deadline. As such, I will set a **deadline of 1 October**, which gives me a month to complete the site. 

I will also take notes on progress, lessons learned, and so forth in this readme. This is to facilitate in highlighting shortcomings as well as hold me accountable to my progress. 

## Notes

### 31 Aug 

first day of the project! Im still organizing and planning it all today. I know I wount get much done over the long weekend, so the plan for the day is to organize file structure, plan download assets, and build the navigation bar. I am bouncing between doing mobile-first design or not. Ideally I would, but I dont want to distract too much from the main objective-- rebuild the site. Chances are, I'll do mobile first-design, but I'm not commiting to that idea yet.
